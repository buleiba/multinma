\title{Multinomial outcome data}
\usage{
multi(..., inclusive = FALSE, type = c("ordered", "competing"))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Two or more numeric columns (or vectors) of category counts.
Argument names (optional) will be used to label the categories.}

\item{inclusive}{Logical, are ordered category counts inclusive (\code{TRUE}) or
exclusive (\code{FALSE})? Default \code{FALSE}. Only used when \code{ordered = TRUE}. See details.}

\item{type}{String, indicating whether categories are \code{"ordered"} or
\code{"competing"}. Currently only ordered categorical outcomes are supported by
the modelling functions in this package.}
}
\value{
A matrix of (exclusive) category counts
}
\description{
This function aids the specification of multinomial outcome data when setting
up a network with \code{\link[=set_agd_arm]{set_agd_arm()}} or \code{\link[=set_ipd]{set_ipd()}}. It takes a set of columns
(or, more generally, numeric vectors of the same length) of outcome counts in
each category, and binds these together to produce a matrix.
}
\details{
When specifying ordered categorical counts, these can either be
given as \emph{exclusive} counts (\code{inclusive = FALSE}, the default) where
individuals are only counted in the highest category they achieve, or
\emph{inclusive} counts (\code{inclusive = TRUE}) where individuals are counted in
every category up to and including the highest category achieved.
(Competing outcomes, by nature, are always specified as exclusive counts.)
