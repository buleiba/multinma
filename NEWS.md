# multinma 0.0.2

* Feature: Network plots, using a `plot()` method for `nma_data` objects.
* Feature: `as.igraph()`, `as_tbl_graph()` methods for `nma_data` objects.
* Feature: Optional `sample_size` argument for `set_agd_*()` that:
  - Enables centering of predictors (`center = TRUE`) in `nma()` when
    a regression model is given, replacing the `agd_sample_size` argument of `nma()`
  - Enables production of study-specific relative effects, rank probabilities,
    etc. for studies in the network when a regression model is given
  - Allows edges and nodes in network plots to be weighted by sample size

# multinma 0.0.1

* Initial release.
