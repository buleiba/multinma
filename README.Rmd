# multinma

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/multinma)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multinma)
<!-- badges: end -->

The `multinma` package implements network meta-analysis, network meta-regression, and multilevel network meta-regression models which combine evidence from a network of studies and treatments using either aggregate data or individual patient data from each study [@methods_paper;@Phillippo_thesis].
Models are estimated in a Bayesian framwork using Stan [@Carpenter2017].

## Installation

You can install the released version of multinma from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("multinma")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmphillippo/multinma")
```

Installing from source (either from CRAN or GitHub) requires that the `rstan` package is installed and configured. 
See the installation guide [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
